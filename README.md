# DIVERGIFY Website Rebuild

This folder contains a fresh scaffold for the site rebuild. Work is on a dedicated branch so we can iterate safely and push to GitHub when ready.

## Branching
- Primary working branch: `rebuild/site-refresh`

## Structure
- `index.html` — minimal page with header and mode toggles
- `assets/css/styles.css` — theme variables and layout
- `assets/js/main.js` — toggle logic and persistence

## Push to GitHub
1) Add your remote (replace with your repo URL):
   `git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git`
2) Push the working branch:
   `git push -u origin rebuild/site-refresh`

If you prefer a different branch name, let me know and I’ll rename it before pushing.

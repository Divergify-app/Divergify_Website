    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
  Effective date: February 11, 2026. This policy explains what data Divergify handles, where it is stored, and what does
  and does not leave your device.
</p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Local-first privacy commitment</h2>
  <p>
    Divergify is designed to run local-first. Core workspace data stays on your device by default. We do not sell personal
    information and we do not use advertising trackers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not exfiltrate your task content, notes, habits, or inferred cognitive/health-related patterns to Divergify
    servers.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Data categories</h2>
  <p>We process only the minimum data needed to run the site and app.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage Data:</strong> app settings and local workspace state saved in your browser/device storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Inferred Health Data (local only):</strong> optional inferences (for example stress/focus patterns) derived on-device.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> name, email, and message when you submit the contact form or email us.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic Request Logs:</strong> IP address, user agent, and timestamps from hosting infrastructure logs.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>What stays on your device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tasks, routines, notes, and private workspace content.</li>
    <li>Local Storage Data used for preferences and continuity.</li>
    <li>Inferred Health Data used to personalize your experience on-device.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>What leaves your device</h2>
  <p>Only limited operational data leaves your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact form submissions you intentionally send.</li>
    <li>Normal web requests to load site assets.</li>
    <li>Third-party requests initiated by you (for example external social links or Ko-fi).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Divergify does not upload your local workspace content or Inferred Health Data to our servers.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Cookies, local storage, and tracking</h2>
  <p>
    We do not use cookies for ad targeting or cross-site behavioral tracking. We use local browser storage to save app
    settings and task continuity. If essential cookies are used by infrastructure, they are used only for security and
    session reliability.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>How we use server-side data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Operate and secure the site.</li>
    <li>Respond to support/contact requests.</li>
    <li>Meet legal obligations and prevent abuse.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Sharing and sales of data</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell personal data. We only share limited data with service providers required to host the site or process
    submissions you intentionally send (for example hosting/forms providers).
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear local storage in your browser/device at any time.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of contact submissions by emailing us.</li>
    <li>Avoid entering sensitive medical information into contact forms.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Retention and security</h2>
  <p>
    Contact submissions and server logs are retained only as needed for support, security, and legal obligations. We apply
    reasonable technical and administrative safeguards, but no system is perfectly secure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Divergify is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy. Material changes will be reflected by updating the effective date above.

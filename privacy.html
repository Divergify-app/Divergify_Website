    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
  Effective date: February 11, 2026. This policy explains what data Divergify handles, where it is stored, and what does
  and does not leave your device.
</p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Local-first privacy commitment</h2>
  <p>
    Divergify is designed to run local-first. Core workspace data stays on your device by default. We do not sell personal
    information and we do not use advertising trackers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not exfiltrate your task content, notes, habits, or inferred cognitive/health-related patterns to Divergify
    servers.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Explicit permission model</h2>
  <p>
    Divergify uses consent-first controls. Data stays local unless you take a clear action that authorizes data transfer,
    such as submitting a contact form, opening a third-party link, or enabling an optional integration.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Default:</strong> local-only operation on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional:</strong> off-device features are opt-in and can be disabled or revoked.</li>
    <li><strong>No silent uploads:</strong> we do not background-upload workspace content without your explicit action.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Data categories</h2>
  <p>We process only the minimum data needed to run the site and app.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage Data:</strong> app settings and local workspace state saved in your browser/device storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Inferred Health Data (local only):</strong> optional inferences (for example stress/focus patterns) derived on-device.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> name, email, and message when you submit the contact form or email us.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic Request Logs:</strong> IP address, user agent, and timestamps from hosting infrastructure logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Public Web Metadata:</strong> page URLs and referrers visible to your browser, network provider, and destination site when you navigate the public web.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>What stays on your device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tasks, routines, notes, and private workspace content.</li>
    <li>Local Storage Data used for preferences and continuity.</li>
    <li>Inferred Health Data used to personalize your experience on-device.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>What leaves your device</h2>
  <p>Only limited operational data leaves your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact form submissions you intentionally send.</li>
    <li>Normal web requests to load site assets.</li>
    <li>Technical request data sent to third-party resources embedded on specific pages (for example font/CDN files).</li>
    <li>Third-party requests initiated by you (for example external social links or Ko-fi).</li>
    <li>Public-page access signals (for example URL requests) that search engines and network providers can observe.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Divergify does not upload your local workspace content or Inferred Health Data to our servers.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Inference and crawler limits</h2>
  <p>
    Divergify publishes public pages about neurodivergence. Search engines can index those pages, and parties that can see
    browsing activity (for example an ISP, employer network, or shared-device observer) may infer interest in those topics.
  </p>
  <p>
    To reduce this risk, we avoid ad-tech trackers and cross-context behavioral advertising scripts, and keep core workspace
    content local by default.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Cookies, local storage, and tracking</h2>
  <p>
    We do not use cookies for ad targeting or cross-site behavioral tracking. We use local browser storage to save app
    settings and task continuity. If essential cookies are used by infrastructure, they are used only for security and
    session reliability.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>How we use server-side data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Operate and secure the site.</li>
    <li>Respond to support/contact requests.</li>
    <li>Meet legal obligations and prevent abuse.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Sharing and sales of data</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell personal data. We only share limited data with service providers required to host the site or process
    submissions you intentionally send (for example hosting/forms providers).
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear local storage in your browser/device at any time.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="/data-controls.html">Data Controls</a> page for current privacy controls and architecture.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of contact submissions by emailing us.</li>
    <li>Avoid entering sensitive medical information into contact forms.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>US state privacy rights notice</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your state of residence and applicable law, you may have rights to request access, correction, deletion,
    or portability of personal information, and to opt out of specific processing practices where those practices apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Divergify does not sell personal data and does not use cross-context behavioral advertising. If this changes, we will
    provide required opt-out controls and update this notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make a privacy rights request, email
    <a href="mailto:chaoscontrol@divergify.app">chaoscontrol@divergify.app</a> with subject line “Privacy Request.”
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>California-specific disclosures</h2>
  <p>
    We provide this policy as a conspicuous privacy notice for California users (CalOPPA). Where California consumer privacy
    law applies (including CCPA/CPRA), you may request access, deletion, correction, and information about data categories
    we process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Divergify does not sell personal information and does not share personal information for cross-context behavioral
    advertising. If this changes, we will provide legally required notices and controls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Divergify is not offered as a healthcare provider service and does not provide diagnosis or treatment. If product scope
    changes toward regulated healthcare functionality, we will update this policy and controls to match applicable California
    medical privacy obligations, including CMIA where applicable.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Medical scope and regulatory posture</h2>
  <p>
    Divergify is a productivity and cognition-support environment. We do not diagnose, treat, or provide clinical care.
    The product may be used by people with or without formal diagnoses.
  </p>
  <p>
    HIPAA applies primarily to covered entities (such as healthcare providers, plans, and clearinghouses) and their business
    associates. Divergify is currently structured as consumer productivity software rather than a covered healthcare service.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we introduce features that materially change that posture, we will update legal terms and controls before rollout.
    Regardless of legal category, we apply consent-first and data-minimization controls intended to reduce privacy risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    If future features process health-related data off-device, additional consumer-health privacy requirements (including
    applicable breach-notification rules) may apply.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Retention and security</h2>
  <p>
    Contact submissions and server logs are retained only as needed for support, security, and legal obligations. We apply
    reasonable technical and administrative safeguards, but no system is perfectly secure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Divergify is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy. Material changes will be reflected by updating the effective date above.
  </p>

      <h2>This wasn’t built for everyone</h2>
      <p>Most systems reward predictability. Compliance. Straight lines.</p>
      <p>Some minds don’t move that way. They scan. They connect. They adapt.</p>
      <p>Those minds tend to be told they’re the problem. <strong>They aren’t.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What Divergify is</h2>
      <p>Divergify isn’t here to motivate you. It’s not here to fix you. And it’s definitely not here to slow itself down for comfort.</p>
      <p>It exists to give capable people an environment that doesn’t work against them.</p>
      <p>A bridge between how your brain actually operates and the systems you still have to navigate.</p>
      <p>Nothing magical. Nothing soft. <strong>Just deliberate design.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What happens here</h2>
      <p>You’ll notice a few things quickly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nothing rushes you.</li>
        <li>Nothing talks down to you.</li>
        <li>Nothing assumes you need saving.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="grid-3">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>The Hub</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">A place to think, plan, and execute without chaos.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Divergipedia</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">Language for patterns you already recognize.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Tin Foil Hat Mode</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">When it’s on, tracking hooks stay off. No fine print.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>This isn’t productivity theater. It’s space for competence to show up.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>A line we won’t cross</h2>
      <p>No one is doing the work for you.</p>
      <p>Divergify supports effort. It doesn’t replace it.</p>
      <p>Effort shouldn’t be wasted fighting systems that were never designed for your mind.</p>
      <p>Remove the friction. Let intelligence do its job.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who finds their way here</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People who think in systems, not steps.</li>
        <li>People who see problems before they’re obvious.</li>
        <li>People who struggle in rigid workflows but excel in complexity.</li>
        <li>People who have been underestimated more than once.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Neurodivergent adults. Parents who recognize potential early. People who stopped waiting for approval.</p>
      <p><strong>If this feels familiar, you already know why.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>The stance</h2>
      <p>No attention extraction.</p>
      <p>No data selling.</p>
      <p>No shame loops.</p>
      <p>This is being built deliberately. Not loudly. Not desperately. <strong>Correctly.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>We are not making people normal. We are making them dangerous.</p>
      <p>The world is fast and idea driven. Divergent minds power that reality.</p>
      <p>Stability before wealth. Reinvestment into neurodivergent youth. Support for teachers and parents. Modern tools for minds that do not fit factory systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Start here</h2>
      <p>You don’t need permission. You don’t need validation. You need an environment that doesn’t get in the way.</p>

  "owner": "Codex",
  "date": "2026-02-17",
  "scope_summary": "Make startup state check-in open only on user action, add an explicit launch lane that links tasks to focus and sidekick coaching, and ship updated hub beta bundle references so task/focus/sidekick interactions work as one connected flow.",

        "Check-in is still one click away instead of forced blocking modal",
        "Focus timer now supports mark-done and sidekick debrief actions"
